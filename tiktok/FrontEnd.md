## Frontend Implementation

### Overview
The frontend of the TikTok clone is built using React, with a focus on a clean and responsive UI. The main feature implemented is a scrolling video feed, where users can click on a video to pause or play it. The UI is divided into several sections to mimic the layout of TikTok.

### UI Breakdown
The UI is divided into the following sections:
- **Body**: This is the background layout where videos are displayed.
- **Footer**: Contains the channel name, video description, song details, and a rotating disc animation.
- **Sidebar**: Displays the like, comment, and share buttons.
- **Header**: Displays the app logo and channel name.

A labeled image will be provided to visually demonstrate these sections.

### Setting Up the Frontend
To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**  
   Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. **Create a React App**  
   Use the following commands to create and start a new React app:
   ```sh
